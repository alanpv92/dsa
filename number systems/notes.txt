binary number system
   -> base 2

representation 45
    ->decimal
        -> 45 = 45*10^1 + 45 * 10^0
    ->binary 
        -> 45 = 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1* 2^3 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 


converision
    ->decimal to binary
        ->keep on dividing the number with 2 and take reminder
        ->continue till quotient becomes 0
        ->take remainders in reverse order

    ->binary to decimal
        ->keep multiply the binary with powers of 2
